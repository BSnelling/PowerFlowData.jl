Each network bus to be represented in PSS/E is introduced through a bus data record.
Each bus data record includes not only data for the basic bus properties but also includes
information on an optionally connected shunt admittance to ground. That admittance can
represent a shunt capacitor or a shunt reactor (both with or without a real component) or a
shunt resistor. It must not represent line connected admittance, loads, line charging or
transformer magnetizing impedance, all of which are entered in other data categories.
